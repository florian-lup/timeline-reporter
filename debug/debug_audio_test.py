"""Real audio generation debug script with Cloudflare R2 CDN.

This script uses actual OpenAI, MongoDB, and Cloudflare R2 clients to generate a real podcast
from provided story summaries. It will make real API calls and upload audio to CDN.

TTS INSTRUCTION FEATURE (2025):
The script now supports OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini-tts instruction parameter for enhanced voice control.
Uses a single optimized instruction for professional news podcast delivery with:
- Professional news anchor delivery style
- Balanced informative and engaging tone
- Clear articulation and proper pacing
- Natural transitions between stories

Usage:
    python debug_audio_test.py

The script will automatically use TTS instructions when:
- TTS_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini-tts" in config/audio_config.py

Run this independently for debugging: python debug_audio_test.py
